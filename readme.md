# NutriCuisine

Hello, I present to you my **NutriCuisine** project. I've always had trouble figuring out what to eat on a given day, and how many calories my meal has. Also I was curious about the caloric content of individual products. So I decided to create a website that will enable me to do all of this, and additionally will be a nice test and a way to expand my skills. The project is created in React using Vite, React Router, React Redux and writed in Typescript.
The whole page is responsible, using storage to contain informations - like favorite dishes. Also page allows login / logout using firebase and is adapted in terms of accessibility.

## ðŸ“« Page contains

- in guest mode is possible to search for recipes, check detail information about it and check caloric content of products,
- when user is logged also shopping list and favorite dishes are available,
- responsible design,
- accessibility practices,
- basic design requirements preserved (minimalistic but clean, contrast, colors etc.),
- using local storage for favorite recipes and shopping list (will be changed to firebase in the future),
- using firebase to login/logout.

## ðŸ›  Used tools / programming languages / technologies

- HTML / CSS,
- React (Vite, React Redux, React Router),
- Typescript,
- Firebase,
- Local Storage
- using [Food API](https://www.edamam.com/),
- git / github.

## ðŸ“« TODO

- [x] Create login/signup pages,
- [x] Add firebase to app (authentication, login, logout),
- [ ] Use firebase database instead of local storage to contain recipes / product names,

#### I encourage you to check the website - uploaded to netlifly [RecipeFinder](https://toolkiit.netlify.app/).
