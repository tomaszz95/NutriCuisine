# RecipeFinder

Hello, I present to you my **RecipeFinder** project. I've always had trouble figuring out what to eat on a given day. Also making a dish from what I have in the fridge was pretty annoying. So I decided to create a website that will enable me to do all of this, and additionally will be a nice test and a way to expand my skills. The project is created in React using Vite, React Router, React Redux and writed in Typescript.
The whole page is responsible, using firebase to contain informations (like favorite dishes), allows login / logout and is adapted in terms of accessibility.

## ðŸ“« Page contains

- single page application: in guest mode is possible to search for some recipes, in user mode recipes can be add to favorite,
- responsible design,
- accessibility practices,
- loading spinner,
- basic design requirements preserved (minimalistic but clean, contrast, colors etc.).

## ðŸ›  Used tools / programming languages / technologies

- HTML / CSS,
- React (Vite, React Redux, React Router),
- Typescript,
- Firebase,
- using [Food API](https://www.edamam.com/),
- git / github.

#### I encourage you to check the website - uploaded to netlifly [RecipeFinder](https://toolkiit.netlify.app/).
